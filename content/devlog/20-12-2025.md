# Devlog — Cursor Interaction & Deployment Fixes

**Date:** 21-12-2025  
**Project:** Aurora Borealis (creative coding)

## Summary
Today focused on two main threads: introducing local cursor interaction to the aurora system, and fixing GitHub Pages deployment issues that were preventing updates from appearing live. Both resulted in a cleaner architecture and a more expressive interaction model.

## Aurora interaction: from global wind to local touch

The aurora interaction was refactored to remove global, cursor-driven lateral motion and replace it with **purely local cursor influence**. I liked this because the maain gloval cursor interaction, though beneficial for early stage viewing, took away attention from the local effects. 

The cursor now defines a radial influence field that:
- locally bends nearby ribbons sideways,
- applies a subtle upward lift,
- increases brightness and colour energy (lilac contribution) near the point of interaction.

The influence decays smoothly with distance using a smoothstep-shaped falloff, so interaction feels soft and physical rather than rigid or game-like. This makes the aurora behave more like a deformable light field than a directional animation.

Key design decision:
- interaction is **local and additive**, layered on top of the noise-driven motion, rather than overriding it.

This preserves the ambient flow of the aurora while allowing direct, tactile manipulation.

## Parameter cleanup & refactor

The drawing loop was refactored to:
- hoist constant parameters (palette, band settings, cursor tuning) out of inner loops,
- remove redundant computations,
- keep all behavioural parameters explicit and easy to tune.

No visual behaviour was changed during this refactor — it was purely structural.

## GitHub Pages deployment fix

The site was failing to deploy due to two separate issues:

1. **Duplicate content sources**  
   Jekyll was attempting to render both `public/` and `content/` directories, causing build conflicts.  
   This was fixed by adding a root-level `_config.yml` excluding `public/`.

2. **Invalid placeholder date**  
   A template devlog file (`skeleton.md`) contained an invalid placeholder date (`dd-mm-yyyy`), which caused Jekyll to throw a Liquid datetime error during layout rendering.  
   The placeholder was commented out to prevent future build failures.

After these fixes, the Pages workflow returned to a clean, successful deployment.

## Status
- Aurora interaction feels stable and expressive - I think some local cursor changes got lost in the sauce (previous pushes), so will need to refine width/depth at future date.
- Deployment pipeline is working again.
- Ready to tune interaction parameters further and explore additional interaction modes (e.g. vortices, temporal memory, or sound coupling).
