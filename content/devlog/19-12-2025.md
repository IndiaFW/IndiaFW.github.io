Entry Title: Devlog Day 1 - Ca
Summary: Created initial aurora visuals, developed project aims and docs
---

## Aims
- Capture the frames from yesterday's aurora to show development, make into a gif and embed into today's log. 

## What I did
- Added in code to record frames into p5 sketch file.
- Created zip download format after missing frame issues.

## Summary
- I created a record feature that toggles the FPS and the S to record for, it takes the full web aurora and makes png files from each frame. However, when lifting this from the web, it ran into problems as the download rate needed was too slow. If we had 100 frames, it ended up taking only the first and last 10. It was just very glitchy. This obviously wasn't going to work at the speed I needed to get an accurate gif. To ensure that the process was actually working, I made a small 5 frame gif at first. The low frame-rate gif looked like this:

![Aurora sketch — 5FPS](../../projects/aurora/gifs/aurora.gif)

- To overcome this, I decided to capture the frames in the browser (press r to record after clicking on aurora), then zip it in the browser so that you can only download the zipped png files (by pressing d, for download). The zipping process took an extremely long time though. I had to optimise this better. To do this, I realised I was automatically compressing the zip, to make the download size smaller. I removed this. This allowed me to take a whole screen recording of the aurora, which looked like this: 

![Aurora sketch — Full canvas](../../projects/aurora/gifs/aurora2.gif)

- However, this still took an extremely long time. I realised that I was making a gif of the whole browser window, which can be quite large. To solve this, I changed the canvas (cnv) size temporarily in the sketch.js file. This took the aurora from an arbitrary cnvSize = windowHeight x windowWidth to a defined pizel size (e.g., 900 x 500). This has problems however, as you have to manually edit the sketch file (which a user wouldn't do), and then reload the site before capturing gif. One solution to this would be to create another window, that takes the current settings and loads a smaller size from which you can then make the gif. However, it would be nicer to be able to take a big one, or just to have that option, so we should explore more compression options. The smaller canvas size gif looked like this: 

![Aurora sketch — Reduced canvas](../../projects/aurora/gifs/aurora3.gif)

## ToDo:
- You can notice the quality difference between the full scale and the smaller scale. Ideally a full scale gif would be great, as the quality is better. Need to fix this. 
- At the moment you have to download the zip file of the frames, and then manually convert them to a zip. It would be good to just convert to gif straight away for download - this may infact save the problem of taking ages to compress and prepare the individual frames. But it is working on some level - that is good!
- Would also be nice to seamlessly loop the gif. At the moment it just starts again, making it reverse for example could solve this.
