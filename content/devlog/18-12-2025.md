## Introduction
Hi! My name's India. I'm a space fanatic whose academic research applies machine learning to space engineering systems. I recently started becoming interested in creative coding, and thought I would try to learn some new skills whilst making something pretty. I've always been fascinated by the Aurora Borealis, and thought I'd use it as inspiration for my first project. So, welcome, Aurora Sketch!

This is purely an exploratory project mainly aimed at me gaining some skills in JS and HTML, but I like the idea of creating an interactive piece of online art that reacts to you. My aim is to create some kind of field, or curtain, that moves in an aurora-y way, and mimics some of the colours you would see up in most northern parts of our planet. I'm not too sure exactly what its final form will be, so stay tuned to find out.

For the first day, I just wanted to experiment with some JS to produce a baseline idea of the curtain (aurora) visualisation. In the future, I would like to integrate real-time (RT) aurora data, so you can see the model's interpretation of what geomagnetic activity is actively happening. It would be cool to be able to scroll back in time over hours, days, months, years etc. to visualise activity. Luckily, there is a lot of data out there to play with, my mission is to decide what's best...

Finally, given my interest in AI, I would like to maybe add an AI element. I don't know yet what form this will take, but one idea is a small language model that responds to your mood or an imagined scenario. For example, "I am feeling content and calm today", "I am feeling bashful and excitable today", or "Imagine we are in a serene clearing in Vancouver". Or perhapd something a little more dramatic: "Imagine we are in a rogue Soyuz capsule tumbling uncontrollably through Earth's atmosphere and the last thing we are seeing is the Aurora as we plummet to the ground...". But first, let's make something pretty before I (inevitably) get ahead of myself.

## Goals
- Create github website and pages for visuals
- Develop first visuals
- Decide on documentation processes

## What I did
- Built the initial web-based infrastructure for the aurora artwork. I wanted to make it interactive and visual, so settled for web instead of a static image or video.
- Chose p5.js as a lightweight, playful environment for generative visuals.*
- Experimented with curtain parameters and visuals.

### *Why p5.js?
I deliberately chose p5.js as a starting point because it feels playful and forgiving. Right now, I care more about building intuition than building infrastructure. p5.js lets me see the effect of an idea almost immediately, which is exactly what I want when exploring something as organic and hard to define as an aurora.

This also feels like a safe place to make mistakes. I can write code that isn’t optimal, change my mind frequently, and focus on how things feel rather than how “correct” they are. If this project ever outgrows p5.js — for example, if I need more performance or want to move into shaders or 3D — I can treat this phase as a sketchbook rather than a final implementation.

## Decisions
- Treat this as a long-running, evolving project rather than a single piece.
- Prioritise udnerstanding and memory: every line of code should eventually be explainable to my future self - this is, after all, a learning project.
- Keep the intial scope deliberately small: visuals first, data and AI later.

## Next
- Create the devlogs structure on the website. Ensure consistency in documentation.
- Begin experimenting with colour palettes and band motion.
- Add simple way to record visual outputs (e.g., GIFs) for each experiment.

## Ideas
- I would like to add a slider that allows you to change the dynamics - how fast, horizontal banding etc.
- It would be nice to add custom colours at this stage. As of today there are 3, a colour picker for custom gradients would be nice. 
- Settings for intensity, gradient strength etc. 

## Some things I've noted so far:
- The curtain is optimised for desktop. There are too many strands for mobile, and the resolution is depleted. It would be worth making a lightweight version for mobile.
- There is a small "ghost" of the trails left behind, i.e., the background is a slightly lighter where trails have passed. This is definitely something to do with the time it takes to disappear. Minor issue but major for aesthetics.
